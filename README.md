# Choba-tracery

setup(_context, _traceryData)

puts traceryData into context
adds operator

operator takes name of tracery (via expression?) and parameters? (via expresisons!), executes tracery, returns result as string

easy-peasy

is tracery deterministic? nooo it is not, might have to fork and make a pull request

best to fork George Buckingham's Node version it seems

but if I don't want to add *that* to npm myself, I'd have to use a Git submodule maybe?
